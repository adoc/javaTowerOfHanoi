# javaTowerOfHanoi


My Java implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

This is meant to demonstrate my level of Java after One Week of learning Java and programming in it.

This module may appear over-engineered simply to solve the Tower of Hanoi, but that is intentionally done to
demonstrate extensibility.
