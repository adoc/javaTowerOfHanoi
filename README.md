# javaTowerOfHanoi


My Java implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

This is meant to demonstrate my level of Java after One Week of learning Java and programming in it.

demonstrate various learned Java skills.

    Intellij Usage
    Packaging and Namespaces
    Documenting
    Primitives and Casting
    ArrayList
    Interfaces
    Method and Field Access Modifiers
    Inheritance
    Abstract Classes and Methods
    Comparators
    UnitTests

    .tower_of_hanoi  - Main package and puzzle runner.
        .model      - Class based model of the puzzle.
        .algorithm  - Algorithms used to solve the puzzle.
     .utils      - Utility functions.
